This is my first ASP.Net mvc web application. Not very perfect but tried best as startup project.
For now downloading the repository and running the build will not work as it works on a database through net which ive not uploaded yet.

Still you can see the code if you want.

Remember you can't claim this as yours well can use it while giving credits. (For personal projects)
